# WordleSolver
My approach to a Wordle solver. Game played on command line.

1st Approach was a semi-naive approach assigning a score similar to the Manhattan Distance to each word, devised by myself.

More approaches to come soon including probabilistic methods, search trees etc, with different problem formulations.
